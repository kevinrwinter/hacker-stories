# Notes

Because you used create-react-app, your README.md should be the same as the official's [create-react-app GitHub repository](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Exercises

- Read a bit more through React's [create-react-app documentation](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [getting started guide](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/).
  - Read more about [the supported JavaScript features in create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/supported-browsers-features/).
- Read more about [the folder structure in create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/folder-structure/).
  - Go through all of your React project's folders and files one by one.
- Read more about [the scripts in create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts/).
  - Start your React application with npm start on the command line and check it out in the browser.
    - Exit the command on the command line by pressing Control + C.
  - Run the npm test script.
  - Run the npm run build script and verify that a build/ folder was added to your project (you can remove it afterward). Note that the build folder can be used later on to [deploy your application](https://www.robinwieruch.de/deploy-applications-digital-ocean/).
- Every time we change something in our code throughout the coming learning experience, make sure to check the output in your browser for getting visual feedback. Use npm start to keep your application running.
- Optionally: If you use git and GitHub, add and commit your changes after every section of the book.
