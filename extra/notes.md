# Notes

In this code, we call `axios.get()` for an explicit [HTTP GET request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET), which is the same HTTP method we used by default with the browser's native fetch API. You can use other HTTP methods such as `HTTP POST` with `axios.post()` as well. We can see with these examples that axios is a powerful library for performing requests to remote APIs.
