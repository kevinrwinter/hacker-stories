# Notes

... you can find all the [supported HTML attributes](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#all-supported-html-attributes) in React's documentation.

In the past, JavaScript files which made use of JSX [had to use](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/985) the .jsx instead of the .js extension.

... these days the underlying build tools (read: compiler/bundler) [can be configured to acknowledge JSX in a .js file](https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/).

... [JSX is one of my favorite things when being asked about React](https://www.quora.com/Why-choose-React/answer/Robin-Wieruch).
